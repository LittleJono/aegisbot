# aegisbot


aegisbot is a bot that provides some useful administrative features to Discord.
NOTE: This code is not fully operational yet, I have not converted every module to work with one another.



## Installation:
Folders 'casheFiles' and 'logFiles' will be generated automatically.

## Operation:


## Features:

* **@notify**- Allows members to type '@notify' to make the bot reply with an '@here'. This is a workaround to allow you to give members the ability to use '@here' (push notification for online users) without giving them access to '@everyone' (push notification for everybody).

* **Auto-Roles**- Automatically give members specific roles (mapped manually) based on what game they are playing. Requires the user to display their current game in their Discord status.

* **Anti-Word**- A word-blacklist.

* **Channel Renaming**- Automatically rename voice channels based on what game the people in the channel are playing (data gathered from their Discord statuses)

* **Channel Sorting**- Alphabetically sort channels under a specified category.

* **Get Role IDs**- Get the ID of all roles matching a given name.
